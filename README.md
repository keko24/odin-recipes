In this project I will be making a website for my favorite recipes. It will include a main index page with a few links in it which will lead to other webpages which have the recipes on them. After making this website I will have demonstrated my skills in making a simple HTML website. By skills I mean structuring the website properly, structuring the files of my website, using  absolute and relative links to webpages and images, ordered and unordered lists, paragraphs and headings.
